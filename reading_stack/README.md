# Reading Stack

A system for managing papers to read, generating summaries, and developing research ideas.

## Purpose

- **Inbox**: Queue of papers to read (arXiv links)
- **Summaries**: Processed papers with focus area tags
- **Ideas**: Structured pipeline from spark to paper PRD

## Directory Structure

```
reading_stack/
├── inbox/           # Papers waiting to be read
├── summaries/       # Processed paper summaries
└── ideas/
    ├── nascent/     # Raw ideas from reading
    ├── developing/  # Ideas being refined
    └── ready/       # Ready for paper PRD
```

## Workflow

```
User drops arXiv link → inbox/PAPER-XXX.md
         ↓
Read and summarize → summaries/PAPER-XXX.md (with focus tags)
         ↓
Ideas sparked → ideas/nascent/IDEA-XXX.md
         ↓
Refine idea → ideas/developing/IDEA-XXX.md
         ↓
Ready for paper → ideas/ready/IDEA-XXX.md
         ↓
Create paper PRD → papers/<name>/prd/
```

---

## Promotion Criteria

### nascent → developing

- Has clear research question (not just "interesting observation")
- Connects to at least one lab_vision focus area
- Not obviously scooped or incremental

### developing → ready

- [ ] Clear, specific research question
- [ ] Testable hypothesis with predicted outcome
- [ ] Novelty argument (why this isn't already done)
- [ ] Viable experiment plan (low compute, provable on small data)
- [ ] Aligns with lab_vision strategic priorities

### ready → paper PRD

1. Create new paper directory in `papers/`
2. Move idea content to `papers/<name>/prd/paper_requirements.md`
3. Log handoff in `agents/context/handoffs.md`

---

## Focus Areas (from lab_vision.md)

When tagging papers and ideas, use these focus areas:

1. **Mechanistic DL Theory** - How/why neural networks learn, learning dynamics
2. **Feature Learning** - How representations emerge, what determines features learned
3. **Knowledge Distillation** - Theoretical foundations, student-teacher dynamics
4. **Theory-Inspired Applications** - Applied methods from theoretical understanding

---

## ID Conventions

- Papers: `PAPER-001`, `PAPER-002`, etc.
- Ideas: `IDEA-001`, `IDEA-002`, etc.

IDs are assigned sequentially across all stages. An idea keeps its ID as it moves through the pipeline.

## Integration with Code Stack

When a paper has an associated code repository:

1. **Add to code_stack**: Create entry in `code_stack/inbox/REPO-XXX.md`
2. **Cross-reference**: Link PAPER-XXX ↔ REPO-XXX in both summaries
3. **Implementation notes**: Reference code_stack summary in paper's "Potential Connections" section

This creates a bidirectional link between theoretical understanding (paper) and practical implementation (code). See `code_stack/README.md` for the code review workflow.
